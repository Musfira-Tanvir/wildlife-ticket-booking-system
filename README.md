In this program, designed using object-oriented programming principles, users can book tickets for various attractions. The Ticket class manages ticket-related functionalities, including displaying ticket options with corresponding prices and attractions. The constructor initializes a 2D array ticketPrices to store ticket prices for different ticket types and durations. The Booking class facilitates the booking process by generating a unique booking number, prompting users to input ticket details such as type, number, and duration, and calculating the total cost. It ensures input validation for ticket types, visit durations, and attraction choices, displaying appropriate error messages if needed. Additionally, the program offers the option to include attractions, with associated prices, and calculates the total cost based on user selections. The booking process is enhanced for group bookings, ensuring a minimum group size of 6 if a group ticket is selected.
